# Texture Credits

* **saturn-rings.png and uranus-rings.png:** Taken from Cosmographia, originally they are originally from Celestia 1.6.0. The Saturn ring texture was created by Grant Hutchison from Cassini images and opacities derived from stellar transit measurements described [here](https://pds-rings.seti.org/ringocc/).
